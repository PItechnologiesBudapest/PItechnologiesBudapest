> The Ï€ stage is a multipurpose precise, intelligent stage. Our stages can be controlled over USB cable with a serial communication API, or with our innovative UI app. You can get it as a preassembled tool, or you can assemble it yourself based on our description and you can integrate it into any kind of laboratory or workshop environment. Itâ€™s ideal for microscope, optical laboratory, manufacturing, DIY labs, etc.

In our repositories you can find the APIs, documentation what you need forr the development and sometimes example codes.
